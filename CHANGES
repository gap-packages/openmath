Since 2007 Olexandr Konovalov made several further changes in this package
and after an agreement with Andrew Solomon became its maintainer. The list 
of major updates is below:

* Fixes of names of symbols and their distribution across CDs following recent
  changes in OpenMath CDs. * Multiple additions and updates to support various
  symbols from CDs alg1, algnums, arith1, arith2, arith3, calculus1, 
  comnbinat1, fieldname1, group1, group2, group, groupname1, integer1, 
  integer2, list1, logic1, permgp1, set1. 
  
* Extended support of polynomial CDs.

* Fixed and extended support of OpenMath references.

* Fixed error messages for unexpected_symbol, unhandled_symbol, unsupported_CD
  as required by the 'error' OM CD.
    
* Changes in conversion from GAP to OpenMath:
- introduced OMINT_LIMIT and fixed OMput for integers too large to be printed.
- commented out method for OMPut( <stream>,  <vector> ) to have the default 
  output as list1.list.
  
* OMsymTable turned from the list of nested lists into a record and renamed it 
  to OMsymRecord.

* Removed OMnullarySymbolToGAP, now all lookup is performed by OMsymLookup 
  with no distinction between nullary and n-ary OpenMath symbols.
  
* New functionality:
  - New function OMPutObjectNoOMOBJtags, a variation of the function 
    OMPutObject to write to the stream the OpenMath object without enclosing 
    <OMOBJ> .. </OMOBJ> tags, which may be useful for combining complex 
    objects.
  - New objects OMPlainString which are strings of OpenMath code that are 
    plainly substituted into the output while printing/writing into stream 
    instead of converting to OMSTR, which may be useful for composing OpenMath
    code from GAP.
  - New function OMString to return a string with the OpenMath representation 
    of a GAP object.     
    
* Better organising of handling private CDs/symbols:
  - created directory 'openmath/private' to store implementations of our 
    private CDs and private/experimental symbols (this is also the place where
    users may put their code if they will need to addsupport for their own 
    private CDs)
  - moved to 'openmath/private/private.{g,gi}' code for algnums and cas CDs 
    and for private symbols groups1.group_by_generators, 
    groups1.character_table and groups1.character_table_of_group
  - transformed OM_append into two functions OM_append_new and 
    OM_append_private.

* multiple rearrangements of declaring and assigning global variables and 
  moving of reading *.g files from read.g to init.g to fix errors when 
  OpenMath is loaded as required package from other package.
  
* Converted the manual into GAPDoc format and extended it.

* Various technical changes:
  - updated PackageInfo.g file
  - removed the non-standard banner 
  - removed INSTALL file containing duplicated information
  - added openmatj/gap/buildman.g with utility functions to build the manual
  - rewrote the README file which is also the changelog
  - changed the system of version numbers
  - removed printutil.g since now GAPDoc has printutil.{gd,gi} and replaced in 
    private.g ViewString by StringView as it was renamed in printutil.*

The first release of the package was produced in March 2000 by Andrew Solomon 
when he worked at the School of Computer Science, University of St Andrews. 

After agreement with Andrew Solomon, Marco Costantini became the maintainer 
of this package. In June 2004 Marco Costantini made some modifications in 
this package in order to make it usable again:
* provided a PackageInfo.g file as needed by GAP 4.4;
* changed "share package" to "package" as the term "share" became obsolete;
* made slight modifications in the file doc/make_doc;
* added the warning about non-standard compilation.

Later Marco Costantini made the following modifications listed below, which 
were necessary in order to extend the functionality and to fix the bugs, 
and because both OpenMath and the package mechanism of GAP have evolved 
in the meantime:

* file pkg/openmath/gap/gap.g
  - Updated function ``OMnullarySymbolToGAP'' according to the
    current OpenMath CDs.

* added file pkg/openmath/gap/new.g that contains
  - Update to function OMsymTable, according to the current
    OpenMath CDs (for converting from OpenMath to GAP).

* file pkg/openmath/gap/lex.g
  - Added support for XML escaped characters.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/parse.gi
  - Added support for the new OpenMath 2.0 objects that contain
    information inside the OMOBJ tag.
  - Now ``gpipe'' is called using Process instead of Exec 
    (this increases both the performance and the portability).

* added files xmltree.gd and xmltree.gi that contain
  - A function that converts the OpenMath XML into a tree and
    parses it.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/pipeobj.g
  - Added support for conversion of OpenMath objects with binary
    encoding, from OpenMath to GAP.
  - Added support for comment along the streams, between
    OpenMath objects.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/omget.g
  - Now OMGetObject doesn't hang any more when OpenMath object is
    not retrieved.
  - Now OMGetObject closes the files that is has opened.
  - Modified also to avoid using a new temporary directory for
    each call of OMGetObject.

* file pkg/openmath/gap/omput.gi 
  - Updated and fixed functions ``OMPut'' and related, according
    to the current OpenMath CDs.
  - Simplified the code for the OMPutby methods, by introducing
    OMPutApplication and using OMPutSymbol.
  - Added OMPut methods for infinity, a range, a float, Rationals,
    Integers, NonnegativeIntegers (for converting from GAP to OpenMath).
  - Fixed OMPut method for cyclotomics. Now it is correct for
    GaussianRationals and infinity.
  - Added a SetPrintFormattingStatus in OMWriteLine, to fix
    conversion of long objects.
  - Fixed some typos.

* Added file pkg/openmath/hasse/config.g
  - Removed unnecessay INSTALLATION_PATH 
  - Warning about SERVLET

* file pkg/openmath/PackageInfo.g
  - Provided an up-to-date, informative, complete and working 
    PackageInfo.g file.

* file pkg/openmath/init.g
  - Moved here reading of \*.gd files from read.g
  - Removed the outdated stuff

* file pkg/openmath/read.g
  - Now the is clearly indiceted which is the interdependence 
    of the files in the package.
  - Reads the file pkg/openmath/gap/new.g above.
  - Moved reading of \*.gd files to file init.g
  - Converted ReadPkg to ReadPackage
  - Removed banner (moved to PackageInfo.g file)

* added files pkg/openmath/tst/test_new, pkg/openmath/tst/test_new.src, 
  pkg/openmath/tst/test_new.omt
  - Provided a test file.

* file pkg/openmath/doc/openmath.msk
  - Fixed the examples, to make them to look exactly like in GAP.

* file pkg/openmath/README (this file)
  - Updated, added more information and the list of
    modifications.

* files pkg/openmath/examples and pkg/openmath/hasse/example
  - Converted RequirePackage to LoadPackage
  - Added some notes

* in various files
  - Refactored the code, so that the code is split into
    several independent modules (see file read.g).
  - Added commands to close all the streams.
  - Modified to fit with the file structure prescribed in the
    ``ext'' manual.
  - various minor changes.

* Now the package loads, and provides conversion from GAP to
  OpenMath, even if the external binary has not been compiled. 
  In this case, if the conversion from OpenMath to GAP is 
  attempted, an informative error message is issued.
